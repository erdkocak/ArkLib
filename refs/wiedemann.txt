BASIS SETS

There are several natural ways to construct a basis of En as a vector space
over GF(2).

follows that these elements form a basis because the number of them is the same

A FIELD USED BY CONWAY

J. H. Conway has given an iterated quadratic extension [6, 7] of GF(2) that
comes from the theory of Nim-like games.

In our terminology,

this extension

would be defined by

c2n + cn = cn_± ...

c0 for n > 1 and c\ + oQ = 1.

It is well known that any two finite fields of the same order are isomorphic.
However, we do not yet know of an explicit isomorphism between GF(2) (xn) and

GF(2)(an).
