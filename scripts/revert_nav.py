    # The block structure from inject_nav.py:
    # <div id="arklib-global-nav"> ... </div>

    # Let's use a robust strategy:
    # Find <div id="arklib-global-nav"> and find the matching closing </div> (it's the first one that closes the outer div).
    # Actually, simpler: we know we injected it immediately after <body>.
    # So we can look for <body><div id="arklib-global-nav">...</div>
    
    # Or even simpler: Use the same HTML string template but with regex for the relative paths.

    # Non-greedy match until the closing </div> of the outer div is risky if nested divs are present.
    # But our injected HTML has nested divs. 
    # The structure is: <div id="arklib-global-nav">...<div class="container">...</div>...</div>
    # So there are 2 closing divs.
